# 🍕 Pizza Place Sales Analysis 📊

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on the sales data of a fictitious pizza restaurant. The dataset spans one full year and includes detailed information on customer orders, pizza types, quantities, sizes, and prices.

The goal of this analysis is to derive key business insights such as revenue patterns, customer behavior, and menu performance to inform data-driven decision-making.
